## Module 2 — Tokenization, Vector Embedding & Vector Database

📄 **Reference:** `Tokonization_Vector Embedding_Vector Database (Ramu).pptx.pdf`

### Objective
Build an NLP pipeline that transforms raw text into semantically rich vector representations stored in a searchable vector database — enabling context-aware retrieval beyond keyword matching.

### Pipeline
```
Raw Text
    ↓
Preprocessing (noise removal, normalization)
    ↓
Tokenization (Word / Subword BPE / WordPiece)
    ↓
Vector Embedding (Word2Vec / GloVe / BERT)
    ↓
Vector Database Storage (FAISS / HNSW / Annoy)
    ↓
Query → Embedding → Similarity Search → Results
```

### Tokenization Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Word-based | Simple whitespace/punctuation splitting |
| Subword BPE | Byte Pair Encoding — handles rare and unknown words |
| WordPiece | Used by BERT — balances vocabulary size and coverage |

### Embedding Techniques

| Model | Type | Key Strength |
|-------|------|--------------|
| Word2Vec (Skip-gram / CBOW) | Static | Captures local word context |
| GloVe | Static | Global co-occurrence statistics |
| BERT | Contextual | Bidirectional — context-aware representation |

### Vector Search Methods

| Tool | Algorithm | Best For |
|------|-----------|----------|
| FAISS | ANN (GPU-accelerated) | Large-scale fast retrieval |
| HNSW | Graph-based ANN | High accuracy at scale |
| Annoy | Tree-based ANN | Memory-efficient search |

### Results

## Module 3 — NLP: Word Embeddings & Language Model Evaluation

### Word Representation Methods Evaluated
- One-hot encoding and co-occurrence matrices with LSA/SVD dimensionality reduction
- Skip-gram and CBOW Word2Vec models
- GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation)

### Semantic Similarity Benchmarks

| Dataset | Description |

| WS353 | WordSim-353 — human-rated word similarity pairs |
| MC | Miller & Charles similarity judgments |
| RG | Rubenstein & Goodenough word pairs |
| SCWS | Stanford Contextual Word Similarity |
| RW | Stanford Rare Words |

> ✅ **GloVe achieved top performance on all five benchmarks**

### Neural Dependency Parser
```

```

| Parser | Speed | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| MaltParser (baseline) | ~200 sent/sec | Rule-based |
| MSTParser (baseline) | ~100 sent/sec | Graph-based |
| **Neural Parser (ours)** | **654 sent/sec** | Competitive UAS/LAS accuracy |

### Language Model Perplexity

| Model | Perplexity | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| N-gram | Highest | No long-range context |
| RNN | Medium | Short memory window |
| **2-layer LSTM** | **30 (best)** | Strong long-range dependency modeling |

> 2-layer LSTM outperformed all baselines — confirming transformer-based attention as the strongest architecture for sequence modeling.

## Module 4 — Fine-Tuning & RAG for LLM Accuracy

📄 **Reference:** `Fine-Tuning & RAG.pdf`

### Objective
Reduce LLM hallucination anomaly by implementing and comparing iterative retrieval strategies and adaptive fine-tuning across multiple LLM architectures.

### Techniques Implemented

**Iter-RetGen — Iterative RAG**
```
Query → LLM Generation → Retrieval → Re-generation → ... → Final Answer
```
- Cross-validates generated responses against external knowledge sources
- Iteratively refines output accuracy through repeated retrieval passes

**ACTD — Answer Candidates and Task Decomposition**
```
Query
  ↓
LLM confidence check
  ↓
Sufficient knowledge?  →  Yes → Direct answer
       ↓ No
Task decomposition into sub-questions
       ↓
Targeted retrieval per sub-question
       ↓
Composed final answer
```
- Adaptive — only retrieves when LLM internal knowledge is insufficient
- Reduces unnecessary retrieval overhead on simpler queries

### Benchmark Results (across 4 LLM architectures)

| Strategy | Accuracy | Efficiency |
|----------|----------|------------|
| No retrieval (baseline) | Lowest | Highest |
| Single-pass RAG | Moderate | High |
| Iter-RetGen | High | Moderate |
| **ACTD** | **Matched / exceeded Iter-RetGen** | **Best** |

> ACTD demonstrated that structured question decomposition produces more accurate and contextually grounded responses than iterative retrieval alone — with lower computational cost.

```

**Key Concepts Evaluated**

### ML vs. Deep Learning Comparison

| Dimension | Machine Learning | Deep Learning |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Data requirements | Small–medium datasets | Large datasets required |
| Feature engineering | Manual extraction needed | Automatic feature learning |

## Module 6 — SLM vs. LLM: Architecture, Scaling & Deployment Tradeoff Analysis

📄 **Reference:** `SLM and LLM.pdf`

### Objective
Provide a rigorous technical comparison of Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to inform practical deployment decisions for industrial AI systems.

### Scale Definitions

| Category | Parameter Range | Examples |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| SLM | 100M – 5B | DistilBERT, Phi-2, Mistral 7B |
| LLM | 5B+ | GPT-4, LLaMA 70B, Claude |

### Five-Dimension Analysis

**1. Transformer Foundations** — Both share the same core architecture but differ in depth, width, attention heads, and training data scale.

**2. Attention Mechanisms**
- SLMs: Efficient attention variants (grouped-query, sliding window) for reduced memory
- LLMs: Full multi-head attention supporting broader context and richer reasoning

**3. Scaling Laws** — Based on Kaplan et al. and Hoffmann et al. (Chinchilla): optimal model size depends on compute budget and dataset size. Diminishing returns observed beyond certain thresholds.

**4. Efficiency Tradeoffs**

| Factor | SLM | LLM |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Latency | ✅ Low | ❌ High |
| Memory footprint | ✅ Low | ❌ High |
| Cost per query | ✅ Low | ❌ High |
| Edge / on-device | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Open-ended reasoning | ❌ Limited | ✅ Strong |
| Complex multi-step tasks | ❌ Limited | ✅ Strong |

**5. Recommended Hybrid Architecture**
```
Incoming Query
       ↓
  Complexity Router
       ↓
Simple / Domain Query  →  SLM  (fast, local inference)
Complex / Open Query   →  LLM  (orchestration + reasoning)
       ↓
    Response
```

> Hybrid architectures deliver the best of both worlds — LLMs for complex reasoning, SLMs for speed, cost, and privacy.
